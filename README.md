# What is this?
This is a small modification for the beloved game, "Book of Hours", to make the books demonstrate what memories they provide after re-reading.

# How do I use this?
1. Download the package from [this link][https://github.com/fiberoptics-0/books-with-memories/releases/download/1.0.0/books-with-memories.rar] and decompress it. You will find a folder named "bh_Data" inside.
2. Navigate to your game's root folder. You can do this by right-clicking the game in the Steam library and "Manage" -> "Browse local files"
3. Drag the "bh_Data" folder into the game's root folder. The system will ask you whether to replace some files. Replace all the files.
4. Start your game!

# It's not working / My game crashed!
If the mod is not working as intended, you can remove it by revalidating game files in Steam.
Then you can post something on the "Issues" tab to let me know about the problem.
